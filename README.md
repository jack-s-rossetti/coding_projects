Miscellaneous coding projects for various tasks/interests. 
I'll be attempting to replicate most codes in different lang-
-uages to help improve my abilities as a programmer and soft-
ware developer. The aim is to produce readable codes that can 
act as tutorials/helpful references for others.

My interests are optimization, data science, machine learning,
and other applied mathematics/computer science areas.
